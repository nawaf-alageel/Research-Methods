# 🌌 Automated Data Collection and Analysis of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)

## 📄 Overview

This project focuses on automating the collection and preparation of data related to Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) using the NASA NEO Feed API. The collected data includes details about NEOs' physical characteristics, orbital parameters, and close-approach information. The methodology ensures scalability, efficiency, and reusability for future analysis and machine learning applications.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Automate data collection of NEOs using NASA's APIs.
- Ensure data accuracy through cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
- Provide reusable scripts for continuous data collection.
- Analyze the data for scientific research, risk assessment, and educational purposes.
